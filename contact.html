      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        If there ever was a time when not to start an ABBA fan club, 1986 was
        that year. The fans had finally started to accept that the band would
        never get together again, the ABBA Magazine had ceased to exist, and
        most fan clubs had already closed down or were about to. Worst of all,
        when the much awaited live album was finally released, it failed to
        chart at all in most countries and was not even released in the UK. Just
        a few years earlier, it would have topped the charts all over the
        world.Still, in The Netherlands, a group of fans thought that ABBA were
        too good to be forgotten and decided to start a fan club anyway – one
        they named ABBF – Agnetha, Benny, Björn, Frida Fan Club – because the
        members had moved on, with Agnetha and Frida busy with solo projects and
        Björn and Benny involved in Chess and with Gemini. Looking back, to
        steer clear of the word ABBA in the name might have been a stroke of
        genius as they immediately got the green light from the members'
        spokesperson, Görel Hanser.
