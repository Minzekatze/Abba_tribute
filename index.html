      <h1>Swedish supergroup called ABBA</h1>

        ABBA (formerly named Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid or Björn &
        Benny, Agnetha & Frida) are a Swedish supergroup formed in Stockholm in
        1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid
        Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their
        first names arranged as a palindrome. One of the most popular and
        successful musical groups of all time, they became one of the
        best-selling music acts in the history of popular music, topping the
        charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982, and in 2022.

        Ulvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented
        with new sounds and vocal arrangements. "People Need Love" was released
        in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given
        much greater prominence. Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited
        to Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid. The song peaked at number 17 in
        the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them
        they were on to something. The single also became the first record to
        chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number
        114 on the Cashbox singles chart and number 117 on the Record World
        singles chart. Labelled as Björn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka- meaning
        Swedish Girl), it was released there through Playboy Records. This
        association with Playboy caused much confusion, many mistaking it for
        soft-core porn, including the record companies in the US and the UK,
        according to Ulvaeus, since it was common in Sweden at the time.
        According to Stig Anderson, "People Need Love" could have been a much
        bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have
        the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from
        retailers and radio programmers.

      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        If there ever was a time when not to start an ABBA fan club, 1986 was
        that year. The fans had finally started to accept that the band would
        never get together again, the ABBA Magazine had ceased to exist, and
        most fan clubs had already closed down or were about to. Worst of all,
        when the much awaited live album was finally released, it failed to
        chart at all in most countries and was not even released in the UK. Just
        a few years earlier, it would have topped the charts all over the
        world.Still, in The Netherlands, a group of fans thought that ABBA were
        too good to be forgotten and decided to start a fan club anyway – one
        they named ABBF – Agnetha, Benny, Björn, Frida Fan Club – because the
        members had moved on, with Agnetha and Frida busy with solo projects and
        Björn and Benny involved in Chess and with Gemini. Looking back, to
        steer clear of the word ABBA in the name might have been a stroke of
        genius as they immediately got the green light from the members'
        spokesperson, Görel Hanser.
